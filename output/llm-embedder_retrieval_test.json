Wang testified that he heard Bankman-Fried tell another trader that it was okay to continue withdrawing money from the account as long as the amount was less than FTX\u2019s total trading revenue. A little later, Wang discovered that Alameda was negative by $50 million more than FTX\u2019s revenue. Bankman-Fried told him it was fine, and it just didn\u2019t account for the FTT token that the two of them had launched. Wang trusted him.\n\nWang also set Alameda Research up with an enormous line of credit, unmatched by anyone else on FTX.\n-----",

The company\u2019s receptiveness to community feedback has marginally lessened animosity from its streamers, and community sentiment toward Twitch at this year\u2019s TwitchCon in Las Vegas was significantly more positive than it was last year. New features and policy changes announced during the convention\u2019s keynote address, including granting streamers more control over ad breaks and allowing simulcasting to other livestreaming platforms, also appeased the Twitch community.\n\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Twitch\u2019s Chief Monetization Officer Mike Minton discussed the unpopular policy decisions, supporting smaller creators through branded partnerships and what Twitch is doing to mend its relationship with its community.\n\nTechCrunch: I\u2019m going to start with a maybe unpleasant question, but Twitch has made some unpopular decisions in terms of monetization.

Now, our target and our goal in this program still remains the same. We\u2019re looking to benefit the creators, where livestreaming is a meaningful part of what they\u2019re doing as a creator. That allows us to focus on those streamers that are really at a point where it will matter most for them in terms of keeping them as a livestreaming creator.\n\nRight, and that decision to change the revenue split also came out of a decision to prioritize ad revenue. Creators and viewers have said that integrating ads in their streams is very frustrating. What kind of feedback is Twitch going to provide in response to that?\n\nLet\u2019s level set a couple things. So one of the things we knew with ads, if we\u2019re going to get streamers to buy into ads as a good way to monetize, is that we had to increase the rev share, which we did, and launch the ad incentive program.\n\nWe\u2019re helping streamers understand that with ad running, you have to think about it consistently over time in order to earn predictable revenue.\n-----",
